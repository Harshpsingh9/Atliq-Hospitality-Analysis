# Atliq-Hospitality-Analysis-->
 Problem Statement->
AtliQ Grands is a company that runs several five-star hotels across India and has been successful in the hospitality business for 20 years.
However, recently, they have been losing customers and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment.
This is happening because their competitors have been making better strategic decisions, and AtliQ’s management hasn’t been as effective in decision-making.
The managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
